# insanj.com

Complete personal website, including assets and external resources. Includes [Catalyst](http://insanj.com/catalyst), [Circlet](http://insanj.com/circlet), [Colendar](http://insanj.com/colendar), and [Orangered](http://insanj.com/orangered). Head over to the [Repository](https://github.com/insanj/repository) for my Cydia Repos.

This website has existed for as long as I've been on the internet (although I wish [it was always on Github](https://web.archive.org/web/*/insanj.com)), previously at [The Wio](https://web.archive.org/web/*/thewio.com), various blogs ("The Read-a-Thon", etc), and at one point merged with [my Tumblr](http://insanjblog.tumblr.com/) (which has now been consumed [by Medium](https://medium.com/@insanj)).

Also contains [lifeiscontent](https://github.com/lifeiscontent)'s responsive [sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me/) [fork](https://github.com/lifeiscontent/sleepyti.me)â€”use it, if you want!
