			<p>for about seven years I've been studying and expressing myself through iOS&mdash;ever since I first held an iPhone and realized its ineffable, human power, one which everyone else seemed to overlook. my instinct and fascination with design never stopped growing. spearheading my passion was the transcending influence of Apple's products. made out of a beautiful harmony, these gadgets appeared to me as the construction of a bridge between two essential things: the energy of the user (the habit-former) and the energy of the developer (the story-teller).</p>

			<p>it dawned on me that design was a communicative axis for remarkable things, available to all of our world. developing is a complex conversation between the hands of humans and the well-designed underpinning of technology, and between the art and the artwork itself.</p>

			<center>&#10048;</center>

			<p>as I understood this more and more, and strived to keep pushing forward academically and professionally, my plethora of interests and areas of expertise exploded. after a few years of highschool, I had a formidable handle on my vision (much love to my high school teachers and <a href="https://twitter.com/orta">Orta</a> for teaching me my first lessons in iOS and open source).</p>

			<p>for the next seven years, I spent most of my free time engineering, ruminating, and sharing. after contributing heavily to freelance communities such as Minecraft's <a href="https://forums.bukkit.org/search/41549853/">Bukkit</a>, <a href="https://youtube.com/insanj">YouTube</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/search?q=insanj&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all">/r/jailbreak</a>, I narrowed my work and propelled into application. soon realizing I needed both more specificity in my individual field, as well as a stronger foundation for teaching and learning, I came up with the three points of convergence I thought best outlined my work:</p>

			<blockquote style="text-align: left;"><p><b>design</b>: contextualizing reality &amp; understanding innovation through human habits and interaction.</p>

			<p><b>engineering</b>: creating remarkable, thoughtful things through unbounded collaborations.</p>

			<p><b>philosophy</b>: pushing comprehension &amp; intelligent expression through pragmatism, wide-reaching analysis, and friendship.</p></blockquote>

			<p>take a look at how some of these have come to fruition through the links around the site. after producing <a href="https://github.com/insanj">hundreds of freelance projects</a>, I spent about a year and a half at <a href="https://urlinq.com">Urlinq</a> as Vice President of iOS Product Development, and two years at <a href="https://github.com/insanj/Rochester">University of Rochester</a> as a full-time student (Computer Science, Art History, Philosophy). after absorbing everything I could about design and the integration of philosophy and art history with programming and software development, I've decided to forge my own path, primarily through freelance work and organizations such as <a href="https://github.com/RinseDev">Rinse</a> and <a href="https://github.com/contextapps">Castor</a>. my current, nearly-released projects are <a href="/submarine">Submarine</a>, <a href="/pianote">Pianote</a>, <a href="http://theappical.com">Cold Open</a>, and <a href="http://theappical.com">Giffage</a>.</p>
